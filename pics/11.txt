That feeling when you finally get your moot memos printed and done with, oh my god. Even the Nescafe burgers, which to be honest used to taste really good till last sem, can not beat that feeling, can not give that level of satisfaction. I mean the first one is of course a mess, but even the next few ones...maybe the next all ones, it becomes a thrilling routine (oxymoron?). You know what you have to do and how you have to do, you remember the exact table of contents layout and yet somehow you, not your partner, you end up screwing one spelling that they notice. Meh, its still okay though, untill you realise that you still have your moot speech left..AND THEY PUT US ON THE LIST FOR TOMMOROW?!

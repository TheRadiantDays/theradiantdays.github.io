Can we please appreciate train journeys for once? I mean yes, I hate the overnight ones, trying to sleep in that cramped birth with snores all around you, but the day ones? I love those. I get to open as many Cheetos packs I want to, watch movies with my legs metaphorically propped up. And if you get a window seat? GOLD! Gold which never gets old because even if you ride the same route a hundered times, you will still notice something new everytime the movie starts to buffer.

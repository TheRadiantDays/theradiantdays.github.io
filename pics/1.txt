Teaching is...hard. I tried it this Novemeber and it was a lot of work, but fun too. I realised that it is not the subjects or topics or even students that makes it hard, but it is the way you teach that changes things. I tried to make it as interactive and participative as possible, I had memes and when the students saw the OG Jaadoo from Koi Hai Na, the shouts were incredible and so was the curiosity induced silence.

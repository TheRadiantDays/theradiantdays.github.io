Hiking...trekking? I really don't know the difference but I know one thing for sure, I wanna do it more than just the hill top behind my home. I mean wake me up at 6 and tell me we are eating McD and I would still go to sleep but tell me we have to go Running Up That Hill and I would get my ass up and ready. (If you are a Stranger Things fan, you must have found the easter egg in here)

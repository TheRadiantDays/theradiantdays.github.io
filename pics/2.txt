Roadtrips are unique. I mean if you ignore the fact that you are driving for hours and hours and hours, it has its own diamonds buried in the coal of exhaustion. To be honest, I would prefer to lay in bed and watch all 5 seasons of Stranger Things than sit in a car which soon becomes a green house, with even the metal casing aside from the glass windows, trying to roast us all inside. But in that one golden hour between 5 and 6 PM, all I hope is to find that one beautiful spot that catches the sunset in its own unique manner.

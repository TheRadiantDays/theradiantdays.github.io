Wedding season...do I need to say anything more to describe the utter frustration of those few days, of the travel, of the exhaustion, of the hundered new people you meet and yet those hundered seem to already know you, or they pretend to, and then you have to apologise to these familiar strangers for not able to recognise them. With all of that, and the food, it is still the weird unexpected happenings, the weird rituals you get to know existed and that new family member you welcome, that make weddings truly, weirdly memorable.

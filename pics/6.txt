One statement that I know for sure is that "GNLU Rains Are Awesome". I mean you don't need the golden hour to click cinematic naturals, just walk in to the admin block on a rainy day and stand at the preamble, enjoy the rain hitting you from all directions because soon, it becomes boring or just overrated. I mean it is supposed to happen eventually, the same place, the same rains, the only difference is that it is an year past the newness and now you are looking at your juniors enjoy and to be honest, that is a different sort of attraction, not a visual one but rather an emotional and nostalgic one.

Waking up in the morning is not my cup of coffee (sorry, not a tea person), but when I do, it feels great. When I left home, the first few days on campus, I surprised myself by waking up early in the morning. It felt weird, especially waking without an alarm...me? But yeah, eventually I was back in the comfort zone, just for context, it did not even last 10 days...and then there are people who remain home sick for months.

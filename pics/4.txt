I have never been a dance person...imagine me making apostrophes with my hands " , yes those. I mean I still remember that one meme where this boy went to this dancer girl and asked her what she meant to convey...and then he literally translated dance moves in words. Yeah, no, I am definitely not that, but when its Garba day at GNLU, how hard you may convince yourself that you need to study for that one CET, you will still end up FOMOing till you end up within the crowds trying to mimic a random group's moves.

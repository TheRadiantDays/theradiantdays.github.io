My mom always took me to the farewell ceremonies at her workplace...well because there was food, and she wanted someone to record her speech. I rarely felt anything for those people at the podium, till this year when we bid farewell to the 5th years. It was not...emotional emotional, but it was definitely 'Oh No!' emotional. I mean I did not even know some of my seniors I was really freindly with were in 5th year, but well, things happen and things have to happen I guess. I will be on that podium one day for sure.

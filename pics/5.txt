There is something so sardonically funny and yet sympathy arousing wstching your juniors struggle with what you struggled with just an year ago. But to be honest, we took it quite lightly, or at least I did, but my juniors made themselves look like actual law associates confused with an ICJ case on their hands. Yuck. I am sure that one of them will be critising their junior-self in front of their juniors about how much they did for a few marks.

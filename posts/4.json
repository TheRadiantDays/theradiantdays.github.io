And honestly don’t wanna know. Because if I decode the secret, it might stop working. Let the magic stay magic.<br><br>Humans have this habit… if something is happening naturally, we don’t question it. We’re like <i>“ok cool, carry on.”</i> But the moment something feels unusual, we want theories, logic, explanations, graphs, slideshows… everything."

A mood swing? A reset? A glitch in the system? I mean, obviously, I wouldn’t have stayed sad forever. Emotional change is normal. But maybe mood swings are supposed to be dramatic. Sudden. Full Bollywood-style. And mine are more like Windows restarting.<br><br><span style='font-size:1.1rem; font-weight:600;'>One minute frozen, next minute working fine.</span>"

I was sitting on this weirdly uncomfortable hostel chair that somehow makes every bad mood feel worse. Finally, I gave up and decided to sleep. Because sitting there was doing nothing except giving me back pain and more reasons to overthink."
